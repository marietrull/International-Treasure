# International-Treasure

Create Washington DC
1. Make a land (canvas)for Nick to travel through.
2. Background of land will be a map of Washington DC.
3. Add a villain that moves to a random location on the canvas every 15 seconds. 
4. Add a treasure object that moves to a random location on the canvas every time Nick runs into it. 
5. Add a health object that moves to a random location on the canvas every time Nick runs into it. 

Make Nick
1. Give Nick basic stats (health and treasure points)
2. Add Nick to the page/give him a starting location in Washington DC. 
3. Give Nick the ability to move around Washington DC. 

Give Nick Rules
1. If he runs into the villain, health -= 1. (If health =0, game over.)
2. If he runs into the treasure, treasure points += 1. 
3. If he runs into the health object, health += 1. 
4. Once Nick gets 10 treasure points, he completes his mission/game won. 


Time Dependant
1. Make multiple Nicks for the user to chose from. 
2. Make multiple lands that the user can choose from
3. Send Nick to DC/make a fun little animation that show's your Nick's face on an airplane moving from his home in Las Vegas to your land.
4. Update animation to send Nick to whatever land you choose
5. Add a mission based on round. If he gets 10 points, go to round 2. In round 2 there will be an additional villain and treasure will begin to dissappear/move around based on time.
